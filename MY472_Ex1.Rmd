## R Markdown

This is an R Markdown document. Markdown is a simple formatting syntax for authoring HTML, PDF, and MS Word documents. For more details on using R Markdown see <http://rmarkdown.rstudio.com>.

When you click the **Knit** button a document will be generated that includes both content as well as the output of any embedded R code chunks within the document. You can embed an R code chunk like this:

```{r cars}

# Load the mtcars package from R
data(mtcars)

# Create a column that adds the values of the 'gear' and 'carb' variables together

data_new = function(data){
  data %>%
    mutate(gear_carb = gear * carb)
}

# Run the function on the mtcars df 
# Save it as a mutated version of the df called mtcars_mutate
mtcars_mutate = data_new(mtcars)

# Return the output 
print(head(mtcars_mutate))
```
